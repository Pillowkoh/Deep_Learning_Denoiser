# Deep_Learning_Denoiser
50.039 Theory and Practice of Deep Learning Project

Implementation of a denoiser that takes in a noisy audio file and returns a .wav file of the denoised audio. Noise refers to background urban noises such as idling engines or air conditioner humming. The model follows a encoder-decoder architecture with 1D convolutional layers, along with multi-headed attention layers as the bottleneck module between encoder and decoder.
